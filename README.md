# shitchattoo
shitchat 2 is the second time i've written a toy chat application that accepts all html/css/js injections.

this time i wanted to play with websockets and jquery and python.

if you are reading this you might be:
- bored
- interviewing me soon (though at time of press i really like my current job)
- actually i can't think of a third reason.

i will be thoroughly surprised, amused, and respectful towards any issues or pullrequests you file.
